# Kotlin 

Kotlin is a general purpose, open source, statically typed programming language for the JVM and Android. It combines object-oriented and functional programming features. It is focused on interoperability, safety, clarity, and tooling support. Itâ€™s pragmatic and concise and makes coding a satisfying and efficient experience.

It is also "statically typed programming language". Meaning, variables need not be defined before they are used.

Kotlin is a slightly higher level language than Java, allowing some more shorthand, compiling onto JVM and JavaScript, and allows for some things that have been learned since beginning of OOP. From that perspective, it is "better" as you should be able to perform more work with less code.

Features

```
1. Concise

2. Open Source

3. Less error prone

4. Interoperable

5. Trustworthy


```

## Processing

Kotlin has its own architecture to allocate memory. It creates byte codes that runs on the JAVA JVM and makes it interoperable.

When Kotlin targets a JavaScript file, the Kotlin compiler converts the .kt file to an exe executable file that generates a compatible code for JavaScript.


## .iml

This is an XML format file that is generated when a project is created by intelliJ. Stores information about JAVA plugins, including  say MAVEN components. It also shows module paths and other dependencies.

## Preferred IDE
intelliJ

## Scala versus Kotlin

Scala has the edge over Kotlin in some ways, but Kotlin is just as formidable in others. The main differences - where the two languages set themselves apart - is that, Kotlin is more like a better version of Java, while Scala is an entirely different kind of Java, so to speak.

Kotlin's convergence with Object Oriented Programming, adaption to functional and compositional programming, makes it more versatile. Write less code without compromsing context and behaviour.

To be honest, JAVA is in a heavy downward trend since the beginning of 2016.

Google have chosen Kotlin Native (a milestone of Jetbrains) and is working on reaching, with the idea of running Kotlin code in mutliple platforms, without having to compile it down to JVM, making it much faster, and not requiring Java.
